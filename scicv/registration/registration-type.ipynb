    "**Image registration is the process of aligning or registering two or more images of the same scene taken at different times, from different viewpoints, or by different sensors. There are several types of image registration techniques, some of which include:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature-based registration:** This technique uses features such as points, lines, or corners in the image to align the images. The features are detected in both images and matched, and then a transformation is applied to align the images.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intensity-based registration:** This technique uses the intensity values of the pixels in the images to align the images. The images are compared pixel by pixel, and a transformation is applied to align the images.\n",
    "\n",
    "**hase-based registration:** This technique uses the phase information of the pixels in the images to align the images. The phase of the pixels is compared in both images, and a transformation is applied to align the images.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Control point registration:** This technique uses a set of control points, which are manually selected in both images, to align the images. The control points are matched, and then a transformation is applied to align the images.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mutual information-based registration:** This technique uses the concept of mutual information to align the images. Mutual information is a measure of the similarity between the images, and the transformation that maximizes the mutual information is applied to align the images.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optical flow-based registration:** This technique uses the motion vectors of the pixels in the images to align the images. The motion vectors are computed for both images, and then a transformation is applied to align the images.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deep Learning-based registration:** This technique uses deep neural networks to learn the mapping between the images and align them."
