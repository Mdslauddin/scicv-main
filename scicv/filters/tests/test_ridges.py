Ridge filters.

Ridge filters can be used to detect continuous edges, such as vessels,
neurites, wrinkles, rivers, and other tube-like structures. The present
class of ridge filters relies on the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix of
image intensities to detect tube-like structures where the intensity changes
perpendicular but not along the structure.
