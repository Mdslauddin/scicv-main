    "**Histogram equalization:** This technique adjusts the intensity values of an image so that the histogram of the image is flat, which can improve the contrast of the image.\n",

    "**Contrast stretching:** This technique increases the dynamic range of an image by stretching the intensity values of the image to fill the full range of intensity values.\n",

    "**Gamma correction:** This technique adjusts the brightness of an image by applying a non-linear transformation to the intensity values of the image.\n",

    "**Median filtering:** This technique removes noise from an image by replacing each pixel with the median value of the pixels in a neighborhood around the pixel.\n",

    "**Sharpening:** This technique increases the apparent sharpness of an image by accentuating the high-frequency details in the image.\n",

    "**Deconvolution:** This technique is used to recover a sharp image from a blurry one by removing the effect of the blur.\n",

    "**Color enhancement:** this technique is used to adjust and enhance the color of the image, it can be used to increase or decrease the saturation, brightness, and adjust the color balance."
