    "**Threshold-based segmentation:** This technique converts a grayscale image into a binary image by applying a threshold value to the image intensity. All pixels with intensity greater than the threshold are set to one, and all pixels with intensity less than the threshold are set to zero.\n",

    "**Region-based segmentation:** This technique segments an image by grouping similar pixels together into regions. This can be done using methods such as region growing, region splitting, and region merging.\n",

    "**Clustering-based segmentation:** This technique segments an image by grouping similar pixels together using clustering algorithms such as k-means, hierarchical clustering, and fuzzy c-means.\n",

    "**Edge-based segmentation:** This technique segments an image by detecting edges in the image and grouping pixels together based on their proximity to edges.\n",

    "**Object-based segmentation:** This technique segments an image by detecting and segmenting objects within the image. This can be done using techniques such as object tracking and object recognition.\n",
